        <l>– the green-backed parakeet that seizes the dense [millet] ears?<note place="foot">This obviously rhetorical question encapsulating the Akam message of the poem is a little complicated. My proposal is to see it as an image that mixes the emotive and the figurative level (as is typical of evocation poems). On the thematic level, the peacock represents the parents/the village who know that when the millet is being eaten by birds is time to harvest the field, and so SHE will not have the opportunity of meeting her lover there anymore, which is why she cries. The parakeet also knows of this order of things: HE will know what is going to happen and think of some other way of meeting HER, thus the consoling message of the confidante. On the symbolic level, however, the parakeet eating the millet represents secret love-making and the peacock the danger of being found out.</note></l>
